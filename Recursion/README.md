<h1>Recursion</h1>

Recursion is one of the most essential algorithms which uses the concept of code reusability and repeated usage of the same piece of code.
The point which makes Recursion one of the most used algorithms is that it forms the base for many other algorithms such as:

* Tree traversals
* Graph traversals
* Divide and Conquers Algorithms
* Backtracking algorithms
